  At the moment I am working as a VIP Support Engineer at LivePerson acting as a Support Engineer and a Technical Account Manager for our top accounts improving the client's trust in the brand and the software while working with our Product and R&D Teams.

  In addition I act as the group's Dev Support and as LivePerson's account administrator for Support & Marketing implementations.
  
  In my previous roles I have also followed my passion for connecting with the customer and understanding their needs as a Freelance Web Designer as well as Project Manager & IT Support at Union Bank of Israel.
  
  I would describe myself as a fast learner who has a very strong touch of consuming information and conveying it in a way anyone would easily understand.
